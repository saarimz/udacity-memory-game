# udacity-memory-game

## Introduction
This a simple object oriented implementation of the memory card game for Udacity's [Front End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). 

## Overview
The user's goal is to match all the cards in the 4x4 grid. There are 8 different pairs, totalling 16 cards, distributed at random, on the grid. All the cards are face-down. When the user selects a pair, the program will check to see if there's a match. If there is, the program will keep those cards face up and the user continues to find the next pair. If there is no match the cards will return to their original face-down position. Furthermore, the system is tracking the player's moves and assigning a star-rating to the user based on the number of moves they have made.
